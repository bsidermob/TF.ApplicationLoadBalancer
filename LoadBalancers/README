This creates/modifies a load balancer and DNS entries for services:

Usage:

First, for non-prod:
~/terraform init
~/terraform workspace select non-production
~/terraform apply -target=module.loadbalancer
~/terraform state rm module.dns
~/terraform apply -target=module.dns

# Then for production environment:
~/terraform workspace select production
~/terraform state rm module.dns
~/terraform apply -target=module.dns

* This will overwrite existing records - this is fine. Nothing to *
* worry about. It'll take a bit of time though. This is happening *
* because resource IDs are regenerated each time so we delete the *
* whole state file to avoid that 								  *
